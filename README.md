#coconut

Coconut is a foundation library including frequent used data structures and algorithms fully written in Go.


##Aims of this project

* Avoid to reinvent frequent used data structures and algorithms every time in different projects
* Avoid to import from different places for different data structure and algorithms
* Trying to be a good candidate as the foundation library


##Status of coconut

Before I give this project a version and release it,
**donot** use this library in your project, 'cause: 

1. I haven't add enough data structure and algorithms in
2. Probably I will modify the API frequently
3. Probably I will regroup the packages like merging different individual small packages into a more meaningful one
4. Should have many bugs and places can be optimized
